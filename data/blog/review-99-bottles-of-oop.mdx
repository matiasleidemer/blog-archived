I’ve just finished reading [99 Bottles of OOP](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/) by Sandi Metz, and, just like her [other book](http://www.poodr.com/) (which I [reviewed in Portuguese](/blog/review-practical-object-oriented-design-in-ruby/)), it’s a very good read.

If you’re into Object-Oriented Programming and you don’t know Sandi, you’re doing it wrong. She’s a very famous OO advocate and has given a lot of talks on the subject. The [one at the Railsconf 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE&t=2084s) is one of my favorites.

Now, back to 99 OOP. The book guides the reader through a refactoring of the [99 Bottles of Beer song](https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer). It also introduces a new requirement and how to change your code in order fit it in.

Along the way she explains a lot about techniques to make your refactoring easier to follow, always taking advantage of the test suite and changing only a single line before running the tests again. This, with some other techniques to make refactoring safer, is called by her as “The Flocking Rules”. It may sound a little too much sometimes, but it makes perfect sense throughout the book. Techniques and tools to analyze code complexity are also presented.

She also talks a lot about the [Liskov substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle) and, especially, about the [open/closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle), which was very enlightening, making for a bunch of “aha moments”. There’s also a very nice topic where she explains why inheritance is good [instead of bad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/).

Like her other book, I really recommend this one. I’m very sure you’re gonna become a better software developer after reading it.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
