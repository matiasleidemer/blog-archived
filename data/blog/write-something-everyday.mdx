After watching [Abstract’s first episode](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6397576/?ref_=ttep_ep) (which I really recommend) there was something stuck in my head. In the episode Christoph says that he creates something everyday. It doesn’t matter if it’s good or bad, if it will be used later or not. But he needs to do so in order to make things happen, in order to create something.

When I was very young I thought I was going to be a designer. I don’t know, working with images, movies, 3D animation and all these kind of things… Maybe because I was so addicted to video games, I dreamt about making that my 9-to-5.

Suddenly I realized I wasn’t creative. I just couldn’t have the insight, I couldn’t create anything outta my head. Of course I was young and naive, but still, I was left with the impression that _I’m not creative_.

Later I learned how to code and I knew right on what _I was going to be when I grow up_.

So after this digression, I just want to say I’m going to try to write something everyday. Doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, if it’s short or not, I will just put it out there. This is the first try, things start here.
